            <h2>What is Section 80C Deduction?</h2>
            <p>Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows you to reduce your taxable income by a certain amount if you invest or spend in specified financial instruments and expenses. This reduction in taxable income results in lower income tax liability.  They not only help you with saving taxes but also help you grow your money. </p>

                        <p>The maximum deduction allowed under Section 80C is Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year. This means you can reduce your taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh if you make investments or incur expenses that qualify for this deduction</p>

                    <div class="cards-back">
                        <p>Let's say your total taxable income for the year is Rs 6,00,000, and you've invested Rs 1,50,000 in PPF and paid Rs 50,000 as a life insurance premium during that year. You can deduct the total of these investments and premiums (Rs 1,50,000 + Rs 50,000 = Rs 2,00,000) from your taxable income.
                            Your taxable income would then be reduced from Rs 6,00,000 to Rs 4,00,000. This lower taxable income will determine how much income tax you owe for the year.
